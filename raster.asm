;; The first line where this routine is relevant is the line 64, but we need
;; to start during line 63, which starts 62*228-24 = 14112 T states after
;; interrupt. The first run from "ld l,h" until "out ($fe),a" takes 183
;; T states and our line is 24+128+24 = 176 T states long, plus we need to do
;; the timing based on the second "out ($fe),a" because that is when contended
;; memory starts The earliest time the second out can happen is 14112+176 =
;; 14288 T states after interrupt, and the latest is 63*228-24 = 14340 T
;; states after interrupt.
;;
;; Because we have 183 T states between the first two out instructions and our
;; first out instruction is 11 T states and our ld instruction is 7 T states,
;; we should start running this routine between 14087 and 14139 T states after
;; interrupt. Handling contended memory makes our routine very unstable and
;; even interrupt handler can vary -+3 T states, so we should aim to the
;; middle, which is 14113 T states.
;;
;; Further runs of this routine should always be exactly 2*228 = 456 T states
;; long, because our handling of contended memory should always add exactly 84
;; extra T states to the loop.
;;
;; On Spectrum +2A and +3 we seem to have problems if the routine starts at
;; 14113 T states, but we can tune it down to 14109 T states and things work
;; much nicer on all 128K platforms, this seems to be a glitch with a
;; different contended memory delay pattern that can be fixed by being early.
